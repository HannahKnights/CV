Hannah Knights is a junior web developer based in London.

### Background


An intrinsic love of making and building things brought me to learning to code. This passion prevails, alongside the desire to extend my capabilities in new languages in order to give me more tools for the job. My fine art background lends me well to imagining the overall picture of applications and connecting the dots between front and back-end code. My interest stretches from deep back-end Ruby through to the interactions between the back-end logic and the user at the front-end. I believe in clean and concise code that functions efficiently to create smooth running applications. 

I am looking to pick up new languages and extend my codebase, alongside strengthening the skills I already have. I am conscientious in my attention to learning new skills thoroughly and enjoy applying myself fully to any given task.

### Code examples

Some highlights of the work I did whilst studying at Makers Academy, all our learning coincided with projects which tested our understanding in real applications. These are not necessarily finished applications but projects which demonstrate my style of coding and abilities. 


| [Mixtape Dates](http://mixtapedates.com) | Post-it | Link-it | Ruby Fundamentals |
|:--------------- |:-------- |:--------- |:--------- |
| My final project at Makers Accademy; a mixtape dating site. 10 days of coding alongside [Jeremy Marer](https://github.com/jemboh) and [Kennerdeigh Scott](https://github.com/kenmasco). My main roles were on back-end Rails and Ruby, interacting with Facebook Graph API to collect the information for our user profiles and some jQuery for creating profiles. [Take a look at the code.](https://github.com/HannahKnights/mixtapes) | An application to upload images and comment on photos became a test-bed to make use of jQuery, Websockets and HTML5 Canvas Object. Post a photo, draw on it and watch the drawing happen live on the homepage. [Take a look at the code.](https://github.com/HannahKnights/post-it-rails) | A simple application to organise links online.  This light-weight Sinatra application was my first application using a PostgreSQL database.
