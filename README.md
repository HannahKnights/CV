CV
=========

I am a web developer based in London.  

###Background

An intrinsic love of making and building things brought me to learning to code. This passion prevails, alongside a desire to extend my capabilities in new languages, giving me more tools for the job. My fine art background lends me well to imagining the overall picture of applications and connecting the dots between front and back-end code. I believe in clean and concise code that functions efficiently to create smooth running applications. 

Having spent 12 weeks at Makers Academy to develop my technical skills I am now looking to master my knowledge of Ruby and JavaScript, alongside broadening my experience of new languages and technologies.

### Code examples

The learning I undertook at Makers Academy was driven by projects, testing one's understanding of the logic of code in real applications. These are not necessarily finished applications but projects which demonstrate my style of coding and abilities.

| My final project at Makers Accademy; a mixtape dating site. 10 days of coding alongside [Jeremy Marer](https://github.com/jemboh) and [Kennerdeigh Scott](https://github.com/kenmasco). My main roles were on back-end Rails and Ruby, interacting with Facebook Graph API to collect the information for our user profiles and some jQuery for creating profiles.

### Previous Experience

Prior to joing Makers Academy my basic knowldege of front-end developing, hosting and deploying was self-taught. Although the practices and knowledge I have now leads me to want to re-code all my prior work, it was the beginnings of my excitement at the posibilities of coding.

A selection includes; a portfolio website for artist [James Clarkson](http://james-clarkson.co.uk) (running on wordpress with my own template) and a website for contemporary art publication [line magazine](http://linemagazine.co.uk).
